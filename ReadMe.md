## Summary

I am a full-stack software engineer with two years of full-time experience working with PHP, PHPUnit, AngularJS, JavaScript, Jasmine, MySQL, and several other technologies.

As someone involved in many different parts of the development cycle, I’m a firm believer in integrating tools and strategies to improve the quality and efficacy of my team.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering and learning new things. Whether it’s maintaining an [open-source AngularJS directive](https://github.com/MuseofMoose/SearchSelect), building a [command-line over-world game](https://github.com/MuseofMoose/Terminal_Overworld_Game) in Ruby, or even just learning the ins and outs of a new video game, I am always eager to figure out and improve how things work.

## Projects and Experience

### [Engage](https://app.oncallair.com)
March 2016 – Present  
Full Stack Software Engineer – Watsco Ventures  
PHP, PHPUnit, Angular 1.5, JavaScript, Karma, Jasmine, SCSS, HTML, MySQL, Doctrine, Bamboo, Jenkins
>
> *Engage is a web application for HVAC-R (Heating, Ventilation, AC, and Refrigeration) service 
> providers to build digital, interactive installation proposals with live, provider-specific pricing.*

-   Developed a single-page AngularJS application for providers to build
    installation proposals.

-   Built a RESTful PHP API for managing requests between the client
    app, the project database, and external data-sources.

-   Added the ability to send a live, public version of specific pages
    within the app in order to allow providers to engage customers
    without having to be physically present.

-   Single-handedly designed and built an accessory management system
    that allows providers to load in custom accessories and set up
    branded accessories with live, dynamic pricing.

-   Spearheaded an initiative to integrate a defined and more active
    code review process for Engage, which reduced the amount of bugs
    prior to deployment and spurred developers to more consistently
    follow coding conventions and best practices.

-   Collaborated with the Project Management team to plan the project
    roadmap in JIRA, convey current and potential development blockers,
    and improve feature estimation and deployment strategies.

### OnCall Air 
March 2015 – March 2016  
Junior Developer – Watsco Ventures  
PHP, PHPUnit, JavaScript, jQuery, SCSS, HTML, MySQL, Zend Framework, Doctrine, Twilio
>
> *OnCall Air is a web application for capturing HVAC-R repair requests from customers, 
> routing them to partnered service providers, and providing a diverse set of tools for 
> managing the request from either side.*

-   Built out the customer-facing application, which included a flow for
    submitting a request, a dashboard for monitoring a request’s status,
    and a hub for changing settings and viewing completed jobs.

-   Led the design and development of several enhancements for the
    service provider application, including provider GPS tracking, SMS
    notification management, and the ability to build user roles
    and permissions.

-   Prototyped an enhanced version of the customer-facing application by
    working through a design sprint with several key members of
    the project.

-   Implemented stricter unit testing requirements, leading to full
    coverage of a majority of our API services and significantly less
    issues with deployed code.

### [Becasted](https://www.becasted.com)
March 2015 – September 2015  
Lead Web Developer – MyStyleBlox  
Ruby, Rails 4.2, RSpec, JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, Google Maps API
>
> *Becasted is a Ruby on Rails marketplace app for bringing transparency
> to the talent industry. Talent and clients can conduct business
> together through the app, without interference from middlemen and
> agencies.*

-   Cleaned up much of the early, unorganized code to follow a set of
    agreed-upon best practices.

-   Built an admin section for the site in order to manage the project’s
    users and accounts.

-   Developed a variety of other key features for the application such
    as user searching and filtering, user photo management, client-user
    bookings, payment acceptance, nudity filtering (my poor eyes),
    and more.
